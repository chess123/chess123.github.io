            ABOUT ME
        </h1>
        <div>
            I'm a 16-year-old student at Monta Vista High School. I live in Cupertino, CA with my wonderful family: my mom, dad, and sister Sravani. I was born in Fremont, CA but have lived most of my life in Cupertino.<br/><br/>I am an International Master (IM) of chess, and I've played in tournaments all over the world. My chess life started when I was 5 years old - I saw someone playing the game on an airplane TV monitor and thought it was interesting, so I asked my parents what it was. They told me it was chess, but they didn't know how to play - so they signed me up for lessons and everything happened from there! Over the years chess has practically shaped who I am today. Contrary to popular opinion, chess actually helped me become more social and meet some pretty amazing people. Also, it helped teach me from an early age how to handle success and failure alike, a skill that is invaluable in the real world. I continue to play locally as well as in places like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Reno, etc. I enjoy playing chess and hope to continue enjoying it for many years to come!<br/><br/>
